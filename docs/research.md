# TNE Quality Assessment Platform — Research & Analysis

## Competitor Landscape

There is **no digital SaaS product for TNE quality assessment**. Every existing tool falls into one of three categories:

| Tool | Type | Limitation |
|------|------|------------|
| **Ecctis TNE Quality Benchmark** | Manual peer-review | Labour-intensive, not scalable |
| **QAA QE-TNE** | Report-based scheme | Ending 2025-26, no digital platform |
| **HEPI Scorecard** | Static PDF | No interactivity, no benchmarking |
| **TEQSA Toolkit** | Static PDF / regulatory | Australia-focused, compliance only |

The general HE SaaS platforms — **Watermark**, **Weave**, **SPOL**, **Creatrix** — are all built for domestic accreditation. None address the unique requirements of transnational education partnerships.

**This is a clear white space in the market.**

## Market Opportunity

### UK TNE Scale

- **653,570** UK TNE students in 2023/24, growing **~8%/year**
- Projected to **surpass onshore international students** in the near term
- **173** UK universities delivering across **228 countries**
- **GBP 3B+** in TNE revenue annually

### Addressable Market

| Scenario | ARR Estimate |
|----------|-------------|
| UK-only TAM | GBP 1–2.6M |
| International expansion | GBP 5–15M |

Comparable HE SaaS tools price at **GBP 5K–75K/year** per institution.

### Timing Catalysts

- **QE-TNE scheme ending 2025-26** creates a regulatory vacuum — institutions will need alternative quality assurance mechanisms
- **Australia mandated TNE authorisation in 2025** — opening a second major national market
- Growing global scrutiny of TNE quality from students, governments, and employers

## Assessment Methodology Analysis

The proposed framework is **significantly more granular** than anything that currently exists in the TNE quality space.

### Novel Assessment Dimensions

These metrics are assessed by the proposed platform but **not by QAA, Ecctis, or TEQSA today**:

- **Quantified staff metrics** — PhD %, AdvanceHE fellowship counts, salary bands, nationality mix
- **Student-staff ratios** — auto-calculated from reported data
- **Gender tracking** — longitudinal male/female breakdowns across student cohorts
- **SDG alignment** — operational-level commitment to UN Sustainable Development Goals
- **Civic mission assessment** — statements and evidence of community engagement
- **Entrepreneurship** — schemes, support structures, and outputs

### Assessment Themes (5 themes, ~50+ items)

| Theme | Proposed Weight | Key Areas |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Teaching & Learning** | 25% | Staff qualifications, training, contracts, salaries, QA, pedagogy |
| **Student Experience & Success** | 25% | Enrolment trends, placements, employability, retention, entry standards, safeguarding |
| **Governance & Legal** | 20% | Partnership agreements, board structures, SOPs, risk management, org charts |
| **Impact: Local & Regional** | 15% | Employment, civic mission, research, mobility, entrepreneurship, SDGs |
| **Financial** | 15% | Sustainability, income diversification |

### Data Collection Approach

The raw assessment spreadsheet defines 50+ items with specific field types:

- **Free text** — qualitative descriptions (civic mission, value proposition, teaching mechanisms)
- **Numeric entry** — staff counts, student numbers, years of operation
- **Yes/No with evidence** — safeguarding policy, risk management, partnership agreements
- **File uploads** — Terms of Reference, SOPs, org charts, policies
- **Multi-year gender-split** — student numbers and placements over 4 academic years
- **Salary bands** — USD ranges for Lecturer, Professor, Head of Service
- **Dropdowns** — entry requirements (A-level equivalents), training themes
- **Multi-select** — SDG commitments (17 goals)
- **Auto-calculated** — SSR, gender balance %, PhD %, flying faculty %
- **Partner-specific** — data entered per partner institution (up to 5)
