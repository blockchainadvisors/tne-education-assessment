One of my collaborators, Leo W., contacted me with a project idea:
Hey Laurentiu! We’ve got an idea for a SaaS platform around TNE education assessment, involving algorithms and models.
People at tneinstitute.org are interested in it:
cheryl@tneinstitute.org; mark@tneinstitute.org; spottyh2018@gmail.com

I'm not quite sure I understand what they need from the project. can we first do some background about the company, and the people behind, and try to guess what this project is all about?
